# Computer Programming Anxiety Scale (CPAS) Questionnaire

This repository contains a browser-based recreation of the Computer Programming Anxiety Scale described in Choo & Cheung (1991), *On Meaningful Measurement: Junior College Pupils' Anxiety towards Computer Programming*, Journal of Educational Technology Systems, 19(4), 327-343.

The single-page app lets educators or researchers administer the original 19 statements digitally, auto-score the three CPAS subscales (Confidence, Errors, Significant Others), and show the qualitative band interpretations reproduced from Table 1 of the paper. Thresholds are based on average per-item responses and are intended to approximate the “Not at all” → “Intense” progression until official logit rulers are available.

## Running the questionnaire
