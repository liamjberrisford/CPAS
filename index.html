      <p class="lede">
        Answer each statement from Appendix 1 of <em>On Meaningful Measurement:</em>
        Junior College Pupils' Anxiety towards Computer Programming (JETS 19:327-343)
        using the original 5-point scale. Once every prompt is completed the page will
        estimate your anxiety profile across the three CPAS subscales: <strong>Confidence</strong>,
        <strong>Errors</strong> and <strong>Significant Others</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">This interactive version follows the structure of the published instrument.
        Automated scoring approximates the qualitative bands reported in the article.
        For official use, convert the total scores to logits with the paper's rulers.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Select exactly one option for every statement (0 = Never true, 4 = Always true).</li>
        <li>The colour accent on each legend shows which CPAS subscale the item belongs to.</li>

      <h2>Where the three subscales come from</h2>
      <p>
        Choo &amp; Cheung grouped the 19 items into three domains to capture different forms of anxiety a junior
        college programmer might experience. Two of the domains measure <strong>state anxiety</strong>&mdash;feelings that surge as
        situations change in class or during lab work&mdash;while one domain measures <strong>trait anxiety</strong>, the more
        persistent sense of capability that the student carries from task to task.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Confidence (trait anxiety)</dt>
        <dd>
          Items 1, 4, 5, 8, 11, 13, 16 and 19 probe a pupil’s general belief in being able to tackle programming
          problems. High scores here indicate a chronic lack of confidence independent of specific classroom events.
        </dd>
        <dt>Errors (state anxiety)</dt>
        <dd>
          Items 2, 6, 9, 12 and 17 check reactions when code fails, when bugs persist, or when repeated corrections
          are required. This captures the moment-to-moment emotional spike that occurs as the student debugs.
        </dd>
        <dt>Significant Others (state anxiety)</dt>
        <dd>
          Items 3, 7, 10, 14, 15 and 18 examine how peers and teachers influence anxiety. Feeling scrutinised or
          outperformed by “significant others” can trigger situational anxiety even if overall confidence is stable.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The banded interpretations in the results box summarise the likely behaviours within each subscale. Use them
        to distinguish whether support should focus on long-term efficacy beliefs (trait) or immediate classroom
        conditions (state).
