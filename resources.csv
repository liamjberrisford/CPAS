"My learning history narrative worksheet","Programme-level Programming Companion","Reflective learner tool","Helps learners unpack their story with computing and write alternative narratives.","Early memories prompt","The first time I remember using a computer was...","Alternative narrative prompt","If I told my story as 'I'm learning to code' instead of 'I'm bad at code', it would sound like..."
"Post-session reflection prompts","Evaluation and implementation supports","Session reflection","Guides learners to review what they tried, what happened, and what to adjust next time.","What I tried","Today I worked on...","Next tweak","Next time I'll change one thing in how I work, which is..."
"Group agreements for supportive labs","Session-level Programming Anxiety Toolkit","Classroom culture tool","Shared norms that reduce fear of embarrassment and make asking for help routine.","Normalize errors","We treat bugs and errors as normal, not as signs someone doesn't belong.","Ask for help fast","It's OK to say 'I'm stuck' within 5 minutes of trying on your own."
"Question-asking scripts","Session-level Programming Anxiety Toolkit","Learner-facing support","Sentence stems for asking clear, shame-free questions about code and concepts.","Context first","I'm working on [brief task] in [language/tool]. I expected it to... but instead it...","What I want from you","Right now I'd like: a small hint / a bigger explanation / a code example."
"Self-compassion and inner-critic dialogue sheet","Programme-level Programming Companion","Reflective learner tool","Balances the 'I cannot do this' belief with kinder counter-statements.","Inner critic line","You're terrible at this. Everyone else gets it.","Compassionate reply","Tests are supposed to catch issues. You're learning like everyone else. What's one tiny piece to improve first?"
"Micro-practices cheat sheet for instructors","Session-level Programming Anxiety Toolkit","Instructor micro-practices","Low-effort phrases and moves that normalise bugs and make errors feel safe.","Normalize errors aloud","If you have zero error messages today, you're either a genius or you didn't run your code.","3-second pause","After asking a question, silently count to 3 before jumping in; say 'I'll give folks a few seconds to think.'"
"Peer-observation rubric","Evaluation and implementation supports","Peer observation","Structured prompts for observing teaching moves that reduce anxiety.","Normalising struggle","Instructor explicitly frames errors/bugs as normal parts of learning.","Help-seeking norms","Structures like 'Ask 3 then me' or a buddy system are visible and encouraged."
"When I'm Stuck flowchart","Session-level Programming Anxiety Toolkit","Learner-facing support","Step-by-step plan for the first minutes when code will not run.","Check usual suspects","Typos, missing imports/packages, wrong file saved/run, mismatched brackets/indent.","Make one small experiment","Add a print/log or run just a tiny part of the code to see what changes."
"Pre-session check-in cards","Session-level Programming Anxiety Toolkit","Learner-facing support","Prompts to surface worries before coding and decide how to respond.","Today I feel","Worried / Curious / Tired / Excited (circle one).","What would help","A slower pace / more examples / a buddy / reassurance it's OK to ask 'basic' questions."
"Feedback practices guide","Programme-level Programming Companion","Instructor guidance","Helps teachers give strategy-focused feedback instead of reinforcing labels.","Process-focused stem","I can see you're trying X strategy here – that's a strong choice because...","Wise feedback","I'm giving you these comments because I have high expectations and I'm confident you can reach them."
"Personal anxiety-pattern map","Programme-level Programming Companion","Reflective learner tool","Maps how situations, thoughts, and feelings link so patterns can be managed.","Situation and thought","Pair programming starts -> 'Everyone will see I don't belong here.'","Alternative thought and action","Most people focus on their own code; ask one clarification question and run the code anyway."
"Trait-aware learning journals template","Programme-level Programming Companion","Reflective learner tool","Regular prompts to track progress and reduce social comparison anxiety.","Noticing comparison","A moment I compared myself to others was... The story I told myself was... A more realistic story is...","Next week's experiment","One tiny change I'll test in how I study or practice is..."
"Values and motivation sheet","Programme-level Programming Companion","Reflective learner tool","Anchors low confidence to personally meaningful reasons for learning to code.","Curiosity row","Value: Curiosity; Coding connects because it lets me take things apart and rebuild them; Tiny action: explore one 'what if' for 10 minutes.","Helping others row","Value: Helping others; Coding connects because I can write tools that make jobs easier; Tiny action: ask a peer what small tool might help them."
